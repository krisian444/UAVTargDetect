Target Detection Video Code:

V1.1:
- updated ranges for color mask
- added object area pixel size as a variable (flat number)


V1.2:
- updated color ranges for mask
- added the calculation for the size of object area in the image instead of having it as a flat number

V1.3: 
- consolidated the upper and lower bounds of each color into a single array each to reduce amount of arrays needed to generate
- moved defining color ranges outside of while loop

- added while loop when asking for user input, keeps asking for valid input
- updated color ranges for mask 
- added calculation for size of object area in image instead of flat number
- displays target number if there are multiple targets on photo
- displays centroid location next to target in reference to image frame / image space

V2.1 (April 1):
- added erosion and dilation for Mask
- changed RET_TREE to RET_External for findContours - only gets the most external contour
